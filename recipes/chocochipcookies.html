    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
        <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
        <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
        <li>Water: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
        <li>Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Nuts (optional): Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the butter and sugars, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Dissolve the baking soda in hot water and add to the mixture.</li>
        <li>Stir in the flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts.</li>
        <li>Drop dough onto a prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake until the edges are golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
